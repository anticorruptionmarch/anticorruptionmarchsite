              <h1 class="text-center purple">OUR BELIEF</h1>
              <p>We are calling on the government of the United States of America to stop abusing the power the citizens have entrusted them with, and we call upon the people to be engaged in the government to hold those with entrusted power accountable for their actions.</p>
			  <p>Our representatives create laws inside of a “group think” bubble with only corporate CEOs and their lobbyists, who can afford to stay in it. Corporate special interests don’t usually align with community interests, yet politicians continue to pass laws that benefit the people who are not in need of assistance.</p>
			  <p>Through decades of landmark Supreme Court decisions, corruption is all but legal in the United States. Because of these Court decisions, money equals free speech, corporations are considered living people (without the ability to be incarcerated), corporations can use their massive treasury funds to influence politicians (protected by the First Amendment as free speech), and politicians can receive massive contributions in the form of donations, gifts, and loans from such corporations.</p>
			  <p>These Supreme Court decisions also narrowly defined corruption as quid pro quo (this for that) while only being related to bribery charges, a crime almost never prosecuted for, in terms of corruption. Politicians can still receive unlimited contributions that would influence their decisions without being convicted. Unless a politician admits that those contributions influenced their “official act,” then conviction for corruption is all but impossible.</p>
			  <p>Our politicians have lost interest in helping the people they represent and are now more than ever beholden to money interests. Our representatives should be creating laws that serve to protect all of society and justice, not protect the special interests of corporations and the people that own them. The first priority of establishing an anti-corrupt government is to write and pass fiercely nonpartisan campaign finance laws that will benefit the public at-large rather than a handful of wealthy individuals and their corporations. It is up to us, the People of the United State of America, to collectively voice our concerns to our representatives, and tell them we want an anti-corrupt government.</p>

          <div class="col-12">
            <p>The balance between money and policy is staggering. Princeton University conducted a study in 2013 about the effects money has on policy. Princeton studied more than twenty years of information to answer one question: Does the government work for us? Researchers found that Congress holds a 30&percent; chance of passing any legislation whether 2% or 100% of the bottom 90% of income earners in America supports it.</p>
			<p>The amount of average Americans for or any bill has no impact on the likelihood of its creation or its passing. The top 10% of income earners in America have up to a 61&percent; chance of passing any bill they would back and put money towards.</p>
			<p>Their conclusion states, “The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.” Money distorted the way our elected officials care about the country as a whole and completely corrupted our great nation.</p>
			<p>Politics has always been a game, but now the winner is &quot;who can raise the most money?&quot;</p>

                <p>In 2014, the Sunlight Foundation conducted a study of the top 200 most politically active foundations between 2007 and 2012. They found that these foundations spent an average of 29 million dollars in federal lobbying and campaign contributions during that time, and received a total about 4.4 trillion dollars in federal business and support.</p>
                <p>The money these organizations spent in campaign donations yielded a return on investment with a factor of 760 to one. It seems that, according to Allison and Harkins, coupled with Gilens and Page’s study, the top political special interest groups and corporations are the victors above all in American politics.</p>
