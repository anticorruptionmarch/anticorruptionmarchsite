					<strong id="docs-internal-guid-2e07714d-7fff-1ebf-72fb-b392503f9332">
					<p dir="ltr">Dear U.S. Government,</p>
					<p dir="ltr">As advocates fighting on behalf of all peoples, the undersigned organizations stand united in calling upon the government of the United States of America to stop abusing the power entrusted to it. We implore those who were elected by their constituents to start representing the people, not corporate donors and the wealthy elite.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">The U.S. Constitution states, &ldquo;We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.&rdquo;</p>
					<p dir="ltr">We have strayed from the vision of democracy set forth by the country&rsquo;s founders.&nbsp; Our government is no longer for the people; instead, it works for corporations. Our government does not strive for a more perfect Union, it strives for profit at the cost of justice, domestic tranquility, common defense, general welfare, liberty, and posterity.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">A very small percentage of the U.S. population funds the majority of political campaigns. This allows them to wield an enormous amount of influence. The opinions of average American citizens have effectively zero impact on policy making, while economic elites and special interest groups have a significant independent impact, according to<a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf"> a study conducted by Princeton University in 2013.</a></p>
					<p dir="ltr">Americans have lost faith in their government&rsquo;s ability to act in their best interest. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/185759/widespread-government-corruption.aspx">Gallup poll conducted in 2015</a> found that three in four Americans (75%) see widespread corruption as an issue throughout the country&rsquo;s government. The thought of a corrupt government is not only discouraging to its citizens -- it&rsquo;s downright scary. In 2017, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/10/19/corruption-of-government-officials-ranked-americans-top-fear-of-2017-infographic/#559ba5b01dff">Chapman University surveyed 1,207 adults</a> in the United States and asked them to rank eight fears from highest to lowest. Respondents ranked &ldquo;corruption of government officials&rdquo; as the highest fear at 74%.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">A corrupt government has a significant impact on the people it serves and on the Earth. The legislation in response to the Climate Crises is a prime example. Despite urgent warnings from climate scientists and strong public support for policies, such as a transition to renewable energy, the fossil fuel industry -- <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?cycle=2018&ind=E01">which pours money into elections</a> -- continues to have a more powerful influence over policymaking. Recently, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/27/politics/bernhardt-interior-approved-permits-shutdown/index.html">CNN reported</a> that the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, under acting secretary David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for the fossil fuel industry, issued 267 offshore drilling permits and approved 16 leases for oil and gas companies. These were pushed through during the government shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
					<p dir="ltr">This corruption is so deeply embedded in our political system because it is legal. Supreme Court cases have eroded campaign finance regulation over the years. The 1976 <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/424/1/" class="font-italic">Buckley v Valeo</a> decision ruled that campaign donations could be limited, but that spending by individuals, groups, or candidates is protected under the 1st Amendment, essentially equating money with free speech. In 2010, the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/558/310/" class="font-italic">Citizens United v Federal Elections Commission</a> ruling allowed for corporations, unions, and other groups to spend unlimited amounts on messaging for or against candidates, provided they aren&rsquo;t coordinating with the candidates or their campaigns. It created the super-PAC, which exploded political spending. The 2014 <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/12-536/" class="font-italic">McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission</a> ruling removed the overall limit on how much an individual could contribute to candidates, super-PACs, and political parties combined.&nbsp;</p>
					<p dir="ltr">With so many regulations gutted, the corruption continues to get worse. Each election cycle sets new campaign finance records. In 2012, the presidential election saw campaign spending like never before, totaling over $6 billion. The <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2018/11/2018-midterm-records-shatter/">2018 midterms set new spending records</a> at $5.2 billion -- making it the most expensive in history.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">We believe our government should be held accountable to all of its people, not just those who bought influence.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">We call upon the politicians, legislatures, government officials, etc. to:</p>
					<ol>
					  <li dir="ltr">
						<p dir="ltr">Stop equating money with protected 1st Amendment speech to end corporate personhood.&nbsp;</p>
					  </li>
					  <li dir="ltr">
						<p dir="ltr">Commit to improving the lives of people and saving our Earth, rather than doing the bidding of the rich.</p>
					  </li>
					</ol>
					<p dir="ltr">We demand a government free of corruption that works in the interest of people, and we demand it now.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">Sincerely,</p>

								<p class="card-text">“I grew up in central New Jersey where the mood was pessimistic and dismissive for making life better for one another. As I entered my adult years, I started to fall into this realm of personal apathy until I felt the need to improve not just my life, but everyone else’s around me. Every time I started looking for a path to start making change, I was abruptly interrupted by the massive amounts of corruption in our political system. I realized, if I wanted to make a change to improve the general well-being of others, corruption needs to be abolished today.”</p>

I learned that in order to start the healing process, we need to weed out the root problem of our political system, institutionalized corporate person-hood. We need a government that is incentivized to solve people’s problems and not just do the bidding of the rich. This is worth fighting for and I’m going to do just that.”</p>

We need to believe them. We need to fix our government.”</p>
